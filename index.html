      <p>Hi! My name is Ashleigh and I am in a bootcamp course to learn coding.<br>
      I currently work as a Graphic Designer at a screen printing shop. I originally acquired a Bachelor's Degree in Advertising & Graphic Design at CCAD.
      After spending 6 years at my company doing design work, I've come to the realization that this doesn't interest me anymore.
      After some thought into what other career path I could take, I remembered that I originally had wanted to be a Web Developer/Designer when I was much younger.
      Not wanting to go back to another 4 year college, I discovered bootcamps and read that they are just as good as getting a degree.
      So far, I am really enjoying what I've learned and am excited to continue learning new coding skills.<br>
      In my freetime, I love spending time with my husband, son, and two puppies. I also enjoy playing video games, watching shows and movies, and napping (when I can).</p>
